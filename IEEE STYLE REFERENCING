# **IEEE STYLE REFERENCING**

In the IEEE referencing style, a number [X] is inserted at the point in the writing where you cite another author's work.

At the end of your work, the full reference [X] of the work is provided. 

Citations and their corresponding references are provided in the order they appear throughout the writing.

IEEE in-text citations consist of numbers provided in square brackets, which correspond to the appropriate sources in the reference list at the end of the paper.

The in-text citations numbers begin from [1] and continue in ascending order throughout the text (unless referring to a source already cited)  

Each in-text citation number should be enclosed by square brackets and appear on the text line, inside sentence punctuation, with a space before the bracket, e.g.

Do not mention authors of a source or provide date of publication within the text except in cases where the authorâ€™s name is integral to the understanding of the sentence.

Editing the in-text citation numbers may require renumbering the whole reference list. 

Please check that the in-text citation numbers match the reference list numbers.
